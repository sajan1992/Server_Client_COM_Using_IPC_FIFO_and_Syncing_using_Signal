# Server_Client_COM_Using_IPC_FIFO_and_Syncing_using_Signal
This project demonstrate the Inter-process Communication between server and client using one of the IPC technique FIFO .
Project : IPC_SERVER_CLIENT
Description : In this project,the inter-process communication between server and Requesting client is demonstrate. Here multiple request is made by multiple Requesting client and the server gets the process done by other muliple processing client.
The communication of raw data from Requesting client(rc1,rc2..etc) to server and processed data from processing client to Requesting client is achieved using FIFO.futher more the order and synchronization of processed data to their respective client is achieved 
using signals.
